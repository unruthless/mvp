        <p class="b">Starting a business requires some paper work. <em>Sorry, it&rsquo;s the law!</em></p>
        <p class="b">The paperwork is dependent on what you do and where you are located.</p>
        <p class="b">Every business in Santa Cruz needs a <u>business license</u> and a <u>zoning clearance</u>, even if you are working from home.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="b">If you are working from home you can <a href="">apply online</a>. You don’t need to read on, unless you want to learn about the best practices for selecting a space and the permits involved.</p>
        <p class="b">If your business is in a space other than your home, it is more complicated. Please continue onward, it’s not that bad!</p>

        <p class="b">Zoning basically makes sure a rubber factory can’t open next to a preschool.</p>
        <p class="s">By clustering types of businesses, you reduce traffic and can share services. Here is some more information on <a href="">zoning</a>.</p>
        <p class="b">The first hurdle to starting a business is finding a location that permits your use.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="b">When choosing a site try to go into a space with a prior use as similar to yours as possible.</p>
        <p class="s">If you are opening a restaurant try to go into a space that held a restaurant</p>
        <p class="s">If you are opening a yoga studio try to go into, say, a karate studio.</p>
        <p class="b">This will make it more likely that your use will be approved.</p>
        <p class="s">If the past use matches your use, the zoning will match and parking will likely not be an issue.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="b">Make sure the location you choose has at least the proper zoning.</p>
        <p class="b">Here is a <a href="">tool</a> to help you figure out what your site is zoned for.</p>
        <p class="s">If the location is not zoned for your use, you should choose another location. If this seems wrong, please talk to <a href="">Planning</a> and they will try to help or explain why it is so.</p>

        <p class="b">A gym has a more “intense use” than a shoe store. This means more parking is needed and means more cars on the road.</p>
        <p class="s">If you need to change a space to a more “intense use” you must mitigate the cost. Read more.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p class="s">A business must provide sufficient parking.</p>
        <p class="b">If you don’t have enough spaces, your customers will use the street, which will block traffic, or use other businesses’ spots, which is not fair.</p>
        <p class="s">Your use affects the parking <a href="">spaces required</a>. More people buy food than couches.</p>
        <p class="s">If you are located <a href="">downtown</a>, you don’t need to provide parking, but you must <a href="">pay</a> for it.</p>

        <p class="b">Painting a wall is fine. Moving a wall needs a building permit.</p>
        <p class="s">When making improvements to your space it is important to talk to the <a href="">Building Department</a>, even if it is just installing a <a href="">sign</a>. The public is going to use your business, and the city’s job is to ensure public safety.</p>
        <p class="s">If you are doing substantial renovations, you will save time and money by hiring a <a href="">professional</a>.</p>

        <p class="b">There are a few issues that pertain to specific types of uses.</p>
        <p class="s"><a href="">Selling things</a>, a.k.a. retail uses - not normally difficult.</p>
        <p class="s">Anything to do with <a href="">food or alcohol</a> - semi difficult.</p>
        <p class="s"><a href="">Making things</a>, a.k.a. industrial uses - depends.</p>

        <p>Once you have your Zoning Clearance you’ll need a business license from the Finace department.</p>
        <p>Business Licenses help the city categorize employers and keep track of its employment base. This is important information that guides city services. Your business License needs to be renewed each year.</p>
        <p>To be honest, it more of a tax than a license.</p>
