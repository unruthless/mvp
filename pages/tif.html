          <p class="s">TK TK It costs a lot to keep the traffic of Santa Cruz flowing. If your business has a higher traffic need than your space allows it is your responsibilty to pay into a fund that helps traffic improvements. This is done by a one time charge called TIF (Traffic Impact Fee)
</p>
          <p class="b">TIF helps pay for things like wider lanes and signalized intersections.</p>
          <p class="b">TIF can be $1000 to $200,000! </p>
          <p class="s">This is why we reccomend picking a location with a similar use to yours. If you love a space with a serious TIF you should talk to The office of Economic Development. They will try to help. </p>
